# Expass 2
## Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved
- I did not encounter any issues during the installation of JPA, however, I encountered some problems during the implementation of this task. In the beginnning I did not realiase that the methods getOwnedCards() and getOwners() needed to return HasSets(), but I quickly solved this.
- I also misunderstood the use of @getter and @setter, and instead implemented all getters and setters myself, when I realized my mistake i corrected this.

## A link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!
